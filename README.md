# Abalone-Age-Prediction
### DATA DESCRIPTION:
The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.
### ATTRIBUTES:
 Sex: M, F, and I (infant)

 Length: Longest shell measurement

 Diameter: perpendicular to length

 Height: with meat in shell

 Whole weight: whole abalone

 Shucked weight: weight of meat

 Viscera weight: gut weight (after bleeding)

 Shell weight: after being dried

 Rings: +1.5 gives the age in years
